# Charm City Circulator Predictions

Every NextBus based app assumes that the user only wants to see when the next bus will be arriving at their chosen stop. While this is generally true, the prediction data often varies wildly and it's helpful to see all predictions for an entire route all at once.

I've used NextBus-api-based apps that only allow you to look at one stop at a time; apps that only update every minute; apps that throw up an annoying full-page advertisement after only a minute of use. The data is free, I want to see all of it. So I imagined a compact view of all the predictions for a single bus route, so watching the predictions for the stops *behind* my chosen stop can help give me a more realistic prediction.
